# Setting local dev environment

1. Install Azure CLI
2. Install Azure Static Web App CLI: [https://github.com/Azure/static-web-apps-cli](https://github.com/Azure/static-web-apps-cli)
3. Add `local.settings.json` file to `/api` folder

## Running with Azure EMulators

The Static Web App CLI provides a script to run the Azure Static Web Emulators outside of VSCode. To run localling, 
first start React with `npm start` and then connect the emulator API by running `swa start http://localhost:3000 --api-location api`.
This has been the most reliable way to start the local instance. Another option is to configure SWA to
start both the React server instance and the API. It will proxy requests to the React instance port to the API port.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `swa start`

Runs the Azure Static Web Apps emulator backed by API and Authentication emulation.
This script uses the React Scripts start and reload the app when making changes. Changes
made in the API will require restarting the SWA. 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `swa start http://localhost:3000 --api-location ./api`

Runs the Azure State Web Apps locally. Connecting the static content to
the Reac development server on port 3000 and starting the API service. 

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
